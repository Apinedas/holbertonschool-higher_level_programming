# Python - Test driven development </br>
Hi! On this folder you'll find some python projects that were already done, but you'll also find a new folder called "test". On this folder you will find test made to the python files using doctest, following the test driven development process.</br>
`0-add_integer.py` - adds 2 integers.</br>
`2-matrix_divided.py` - divides all elements of a matrix.</br>
`3-say_my_name.py` - prints My name is <first name> <last name></br>
`4-print_square.py` - prints a square with the character #.</br>
`5-text_indentation.py` -  prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: '.' ',' '?' and ':'</br></br>
On the `test` folder you'll find all some interactive test files for each module, and an aditional module called `6-max_integer.py` which looks for the max integer on a list.
